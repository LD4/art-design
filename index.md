The **LD4 Art & Design Affinity Group** intends to advance the use of linked data in art and design contexts from a library- and archives-led perspective through information sharing, exchange, and collaboration.

# Our Focus
Our group focuses on the unique challenges of describing and providing access to art and design resources and use cases for modeling, querying, and visualization of linked data related to:
- **art and design subject areas** including visual arts, craft, architecture, graphic design, and fashion, et al.
- **art and design events** including exhibitions, performances, and auctions, et al.
- **art and design subject formats** including catalogs, visual resource collections, and artist files, et al.

# Our Approach
We hold monthly calls open to all to learn about and discuss projects, resources, and tools within our scope. Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/ld4-art-design) to be notified when calls are announced.
