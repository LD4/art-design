We aim to advance the use of linked data in art and design contexts from a library- and archives-led perspective through information sharing, exchange, and collaboration.

As an [LD4 Affinity Group](https://sites.google.com/stanford.edu/ld4-community-site/groups), we are open to all, regardless of institutional or organizational affiliation.

# Our Focus
Our group focuses on the unique challenges of modeling, querying, and visualization of linked data related to the subject areas of art and design including:
- domains such as visual arts, performance art, craft, architecture, graphic design, and fashion
- events such as exhibitions, performances, and auctions
- formats such as catalogs, artists' books, visual resource collections, and artist files

# Our Approach

## Calls
We hold monthly calls open to all to learn about and discuss projects, resources, and tools within our scope. Join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/ld4-art-design) to be notified when calls are announced.
