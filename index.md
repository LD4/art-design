Art and design topics present unique challenges and use cases for modeling, querying, and visualization of linked data. The LD4 Art & Design Affinity Group focuses on these subject areas—understood broadly to encompass the visual arts, craft, architecture, graphic design, fashion, et al., as well as related events (such as exhibitions, performances, and auctions) and formats (such as catalogs, visual resource collections, and artist files). The group intends to advance the use of linked data in art and design contexts from a library- and archives-led perspective through information sharing, exchange, and collaboration.

The group holds monthly calls open to all to learn about and discuss projects, resources, and tools within our scope. Calls may cover topics that relate to commonly-used platforms (Wikidata), subject-specific ontologies (Linked Art, BIBFRAME’s Art and Rare Materials [ARM] Ontology) and vocabularies (Getty Vocabularies), and the application of broader standards (CIDOC-CRM, BIBFRAME, IIIF) for describing and providing access to art and design resources.
